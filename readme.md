## Two-pass "fuzzy" transformer from Perl to "semi-Python" 
### THIS IS A PRE ANNOUNCEMENT 

Some organizations are now involved in converting their Perl codebase into Python. The author previously participated in several projects of converting mainframe codebase to Unix (mainly AIX) and thinks that this area might be a useful expansion of his skills. 
 
Of course, Perl 5 is here to stay (please note what happened with people who were predicting the demise of Fortran ;-), but for some reason, 
several organizations are expressed interest in converting their support script codebase into a single language. Most often, this is Python. 
Ruby, which is probably a better match for such a translation, is seldom used. 

My feeling is that there should be some better tools for this particular task to lessen the costs, time, and effort. One trivial idea is to have a better, whitten with some level of knowledge of compiler technologies tool that falls into the category of small toy language  compliers with total effort around one man year or less. 

Assuming ten lines per day of debugged code for the task of complexity comparable with the writing of compilers, the estimated size should be around 3-5K lines of code (~1K line phaze 1 and 2-3K line phaze 2 

So far, this just an idea, although the prototype was already written. The idea might be wrong, and it might be impossible to write anything useful in less than 3K lines. As of November 2019 around 2.5K lines were written and alpha version works more or less OK on simple Perl text with wrounf 80% statement translation sucess rate.

I ahad chosen pre_pythonizer.pl -- the script that was posted on this site as the asseptance test. Of couse the script uses very small subset of Perl (no OO, no modules), but it a way it is representative of a large category of Perl script written by system administrators,m who raraly use esoteric features and, generally, coming from C+shell backgraund, prefer procedural style of programming. Only GUI progrms are written using OO stle by this catagory of programmers. 

On  this catagory of scripts the automatic traslation (or more corretly tranliteration ;-) can provides considerable labor savings during conversion, allowing to accomplish the task in less time and with higher quality. 

Of course,  when Perl functions and regex are used extensively the result can be simply incorrect.  

But even in the current form this provide some savings in translation effort. Of couse some Python functions do not match 1:1 Perl functions  but that's probably unavodable. Also absence of goto, "until" loop, double quotes literals, complicates the task futher. But simple statements can be transated more or less OK (see below.)  

Some missing feature can be emulated: right now double quoted literals are decomplied and then tranlsated to sequance of concatenation, see below. 

In any case, based on so far written prototype  the idea of "fuzzy pythonizer" looks viable at least for typical small to medium syadmin scripts. 

This readme is for impormational purposes only and is not intended to be updated often. More current information can be found at:

As of Nov 20, the alpha version 0.07 produced the following translation of pre_pythoner.pl (only fragment is shown, but theprogram was able to translate all the code). That does not  mean that that we are getting much closer as in programming that last 20% of functionality usually takes nine times as much to implement , debug and test as the first 80% (kind of another verion of Pareto Law)   

#### Example of tranlsation (version 0.07 alpha, Nov 20, 2019)
